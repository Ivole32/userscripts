# Installation

## 1. Install a User Script Manager

To run user scripts, you first need to install a browser extension that supports them. We recommend **Violentmonkey**.

### 1.1 If you are using a browser that supports the Chrome Web Store:
Install Violentmonkey from the Chrome Web Store:  
[Violentmonkey Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag)

### 1.2 If your browser does not support the Chrome Web Store:
Search online to find out if your browser supports Violentmonkey or another user script manager (like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey) and how to install it.

## 2. Install the User Script from GreasyFork

Once you have installed a script manager like Violentmonkey, follow these steps:

### 2.1 Visit the GreasyFork website:
[https://greasyfork.org](https://greasyfork.org)

### 2.2 Go directly to my script page:
Scripts: [Ivole32](https://greasyfork.org/de/users/1486130-ivole32)

### 2.3 Click the **“Install this script”** button on the script page.

### 2.4 Your script manager (e.g., Violentmonkey) will open a prompt to confirm the installation.

### 2.5 Click **“Install”** in the popup to add the script.

## 3. Done!

The script is now installed and will automatically run on the websites it was designed for. You can manage, enable/disable, or uninstall it anytime through the Violentmonkey dashboard.
